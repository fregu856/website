I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Mattias Rantalainen](https://ki.se/en/people/mattias-rantalainen) at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en) in Stockholm, working on **machine learning** and **computer vision** for **computational pathology**. My research focuses on how to build and evaluate _reliable machine learning_ models for _safe data-driven medicine_. It has often included regression problems, uncertainty estimation methods or energy-based models.

I received my BSc in _Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering_ in 2016 and my MSc in _Electrical Engineering_ in 2018, both from [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en). During my MSc, I also spent one year as a graduate exchange student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/"). I received my PhD in _Machine Learning_ in 2023 from [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se/en) for the thesis [_Towards Accurate and Reliable Deep Regression Models_](/publication/thesis/). During my PhD, I was supervised by [Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/) and [Martin Danelljan](https://martin-danelljan.github.io/).
