During the years of my PhD, running turned into an important part of my life, crucial in order to keep me productive and in a good mental state throughout the work days and weeks.  I'm a relatively serious runner, but I run mostly just because it's a lot of fun and a great way to explore your surroundings, and because it's good for both my physical and mental health. My training can be followed on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/41453104).

From Sep 10 2020 until Dec 31 2023, I was on a run streak (running at least 2 km outside every day) of 1208 days. I'm currently on a run streak of 300+ days, since Jan 27 2024.
