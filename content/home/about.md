I am a postdoc in the group of [David Clifton](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/team) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), working on **machine learning for healthcare** with a particular focus on _biosignals_ and _wearables_.  More broadly, I am interested in how to build and evaluate _reliable machine learning_ models, for applications within _data-driven medicine and healthcare_. My research has often included regression problems, uncertainty estimation methods, energy-based models, diffusion models, or the evaluation of foundation models.
