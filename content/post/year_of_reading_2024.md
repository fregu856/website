In 2024, I read 99 papers and 21 non-technical books. 99 papers is slightly more than my previous record (87 papers in 2023), while 21 books is slightly less than the 26 I read in 2023 (but still a lot more than what I've ever read in a year before that).

In 2025, I want to read 100 papers and at least 20 non-technical books.
