In 2023, I read 87 papers and 26 non-technical books. 87 papers is slightly more than my previous record (82 papers in 2022), and I've never even been remotely close to reading 26 books in a year. Deciding to read more books is definitely one of the best things I did in 2023, it's a great way to relax and learn some new things about the world.

In 2024, I want to read at least 100 papers and 12 non-technical books.


Some more detailed statistics of my read papers (number of papers read each year, papers by publication year, papers by venue, papers by category):
