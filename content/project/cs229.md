In this project, we apply reinforcement learning techniques to control an inverted double pendulum on a cart. We successfully learn a controller for balancing in a simulation environment using Q-learning with a linear function approximator, without any prior knowledge of the system at hand. We do however fail to learn a controller for the swing-up maneuver, which leads to a discussion on what might be needed to solve more complex control problems using reinforcement learning.
