TensorFlow implementation of SqueezeDet, trained on the KITTI dataset. The results in the video above can obviously be improved, but because of limited computing resources (personally funded Azure VM) I did not perform any further hyperparameter tuning. Please see the GitHub repository linked below for code and further details.
