# About Me

<!-- I am a PhD student in the group of <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/" target="_blank">Prof. Thomas Schön</a> at <a href="http://www.uu.se/en" target="_blank">Uppsala University</a>. I am also supervised by [Dr. Martin Danelljan](https://martin-danelljan.github.io/), ETH Zürich. My general areas of interest are <b>machine learning</b>, <b>computer vision</b> and <b>autonomous robots</b>. My research focuses on <b>uncertainty-aware deep learning</b> for <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>medical imaging</b>. -->

I received my BSc in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering in 2016 and my MSc in Electrical Engineering in 2018, both from <a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank">Linköping University</a>. Upon graduation, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.lith.liu.se/examenshogtid/tryggve-holm-medalj-och-diplom?l=sv" target="_blank">Tryggve Holm medal</a> for outstanding student achievements. The first year of my MSc studies was spent as an exchange student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>. I have industry experience from <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html" target="_blank">BMW Group</a> (Germany), <a href="https://www.zenuity.com/" target="_blank">Zenuity</a> (Sweden) and <a href="http://www.t-engineering.se/" target="_blank">T Engineering</a> (Sweden).
